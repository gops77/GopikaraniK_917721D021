We create 4 tables in MySQL naming customer, product, bill, billproduct to maintain all the records and also employ changes in the table by getting input from the user or employee using the GUI created using AWT. We divide whole java project into 6 different classes to make the coide more understandable and easily accessible. Each class in the package performs specific task as assigned. We employed OOPs concepts like inheritence encapsulation to make the code more Efficient and optimal.
